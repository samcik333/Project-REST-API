# RESTAPI for intership

First of all this REST API app is about to allow users to create and maintain custom collections of Hacker News stories.
## Start app  
First we open two terminals.  
### First terminal
Write a command `npm i` to install packages and then
write a command `docker-compose up` which connects us to the Postgres database.
### Second terminal
Write a command `npm run start` which connects us to the http://localhost:3000 server.
